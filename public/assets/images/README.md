# Comic Book Cover Images

This folder is for the comic book cover images.

Please upload all your comic book cover images into this directory. The application is configured to look for them here.

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure the filename for each image exactly matches the `id` of the comic in `data/comics.ts` and has a `.jpg` extension.

For example:
- The comic with `id: 'm-001'` should have an image named `m-001.jpg`.
- The comic with `id: 'd-001'` should have an image named `d-001.jpg`.
- The comic with `id: 'i-001'` should have an image named `i-001.jpg`.
